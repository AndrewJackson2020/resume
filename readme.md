# Resume 

## Summary
This repository is used for version controlling and defining my resume in plain text. 
I use LaTeX and more specifically the ModernCV package to do much of the heavy lifting.

## How to use

Ignore changes to variables file (contains PII)
```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged secrets.tex
```

## Future development
- Possibly to create personal website and add to resume
- Dockerize
